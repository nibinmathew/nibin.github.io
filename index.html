<p> Welcome to your first ever web page. </p>

<div>
Through these pages, you will enter into an exciting journey of learning to travel through the online world.

You can read the information on this page (and any other webpage) using the same keystrokes that are used to read a text file on Notepad.
For instance, try using the following keystrokes:<br>
To go to the top of the page: Ctrl+Home<br>
To go to the bottom of the page: Ctrl+End<br>
To go to the next and previous line: Up and Down Arrow <br>
To go to the next or previous  character: Right and Left Arrow keys <br>
To read the  current line: NVDA+Up Arrow<br>
Now, try typing the first letter of your name on this page.
As you must have just noticed, it is impossible to type anything on a webpage. Although it appears like a notepad file when it comes to navigating and reading the text, you will not be able to type anything on the page.
At the end of this page, I have provided a link. If you press space on it, I will show you the next page.
