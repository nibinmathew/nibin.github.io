<p> In the previous story, Did you hear NVDA say “heading level 1 The hare and tortoise?” This was the title of the story. Did you read the different paragraphs? This was the content given below the previous heading.
Similarly, all the information provided in web pages will be under different headings. We can see the main headings, sub headings, headings inside subheadings and more. 
Read the below information.  Pay careful attention to how NVDA pronounces different headings and subheadings.

<h1>Vehicle</h1>

<h2>Vehicles on road:</h2>
Car<br>
Cycle<br>
Busses<br>

<h2>Vehicles on water:</h2>
Ships<br>

<p>
Did you hear NVDA announce “heading Level 1” and “Heading Level 2”? Main headings are announced as “Heading Level 1”.Headings under that are announced as “Heading Level 2”.
