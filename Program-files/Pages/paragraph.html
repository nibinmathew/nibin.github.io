<p>Great, You did it!<p>

Now you are on the second page of this website.
Let me tell you what all you can see on websites and webpages.
A web page contains text, images (photos), videos, audio, etc. You can read the text content, view images and videos, play music or other audio files, and even play games on the internet.
A website is a collection of many such web pages put together. Each of these webpages may have any or all the above mentioned components.
In order to view a website, you need something called a URL. Just like your address gives people information about where you live so that others can visit you, a URL is the information about where a webpage can be found on the internet.

When you open a URL, it will take you to one of the web pages of a website. From there you can navigate to other pages of a website using what are called links.
For instance, this is the second page of a website. Pressing Space or Enter key on the link called “next” on the previous webpage brought you to this new webpage.

There are links called “Next” and “Previous” at the end of this page. If you activate the Next link, you will move to the next page or if you activate the Previous link, you can see the last page you have seen. Try pressing the Spacebar or Enter key on any of them to see what happens.
See you on the next page!
